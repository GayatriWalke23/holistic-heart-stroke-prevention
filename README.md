# Heart Stroke Prevention: A Holistic Approach
Predict heart stroke occurrences and identify key risk factors using machine learning algorithms.

#### This project is divided into two phases:
- ### Phase 1: Data Collection and Cleaning
  - Collected clinical and risk factor data.
  - Cleaned the dataset by removing null values and encoding categorical variables.
  - Standardized numerical features.
- ### Phase 2: Data Analysis and Model Implementation
  - Preprocessed data: binary encoding, label encoding, data splitting, standardization.
  - Implemented and evaluated six algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Neural Network
## Code

You can find the code for the entire project in the src folder.
